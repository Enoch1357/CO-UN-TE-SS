COUNTESS is a simple and user friendly web app designed by me to be used as a countdown application.

TECCHNOLOGIES EMPLOYED
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT

FEATURES
- Users can create and set countdowns for future events.
- Users can also edit existing countdown info, in cases of wrong input info.
- Users can also remove event countdowns with the click of a button if they are no more wanted or when the timer elapses.
- Events countdowns are displayed with variable colors depending on the category selected for them, like a little color-coding system to aid quick scanning with the eyes when searching for a particular event countdown.

Enjoy
